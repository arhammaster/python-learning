# Write a function to check if a given year is a leap year. A leap year is:
#
# Basic rule: 
#   A year divisible by 4 is usually a leap year. 
# Exception for century years: 
#   If a year is a century year (divisible by 100) but 
#   not 
#   divisible by 400, it is not a leap year. 
#
# Example: 
#   2000 is a leap year because it is divisible by 400, 
#   1900 is NOT a leap year because it is only divisible by 100.
#   2024, 2016 are a leap year because it is divisible by 4
#   2025 is not a leap year because it is NOT divisible by 4
#
# Learn:
#   first learn math operation / and % 
#       % will give reminder 
#       / will divide and give result
#
# INPUT
#   Enter Yhe Year : 2000
#
# OUTPUT
#   2000, is a leap year because it is divisible by 400
