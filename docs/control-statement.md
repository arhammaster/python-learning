# Control Statements

## if-else

If else is a condition statement that checks or compares a variable or number. After compares if condition is right then the code under if block is used otherwise else block.

```python

if a == b :
    print ("a and b are equal")
else :
    print ("a and b are not equal")

```

If a = 5 and b = 7 if condition is not correct so else is used that prints a and b is not equal , but a = 5 and b = 5 if is correct so it prints a and b is equal
